Introduction
============
The FIND software platform is designed to be a user-friendly tool for analysis 
and visualization of Flow Cytometry data, revolving around automated methods 
based on multi-dimensional mathematical inspection of relationships between 
sampled cells and their recorded fluorescence emissions.

FIND is also designed to be a platform for development and distribution of 
new analysis and visualization methods, simplifying the process of finding and 
using new research in Flow Cytometry analysis. If you are interested in 
developing plugins for FIND, please visit the developer documentation on the 
main documentation page (link at the top left).

The main website for FIND is located at:

`http://www.justicelab.org/find <http://www.justicelab.org/find>`_

The current version (as indicated at the top of the page) of FIND is available 
there for download, as well as any plugins. For help and questions that are not 
addressed here, support forums exist at FIND's 
`Sourceforge project page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/fc-find/support>`_.
